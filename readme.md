# Google Spring boot rest api authorization server

This **Spring Boot Starter** can be your ready to use middleware server for your Flutter, React Native, Native Mobile or Web Frontends projects with **Spring Security** to seamlessly create and consume protected rest API's.

Note:-

This server does not use spring security's Oauth2 social library but rather uses google's api client in combination with spring security's http security functionality to provide a simple yet secure authorization solution.

### Configuration

Register your application at https://console.developers.google.com and create creantials.

security.google-props.client-ids accepts an array of client_ids, you configure one for each platform like IOS,WEB,ANDROID.

### UI Demo

- To try the demo ui , edit html under ui folder to replace content of meta tag with name "google-signin-client_id" to your web client_id.

- Run with live-server or http-server
